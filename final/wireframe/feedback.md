# Final Projects : Wireframe Review

Notes on the scope and subject of your final projects:

* It should be a stand-alone project with predictable interaction patterns with third-party services. So interaction with services that you built/setup yourself is fine, public APIs are fine, but please refrain from using company services to feed or power your application. We don't want to introduce risky/unpredictable elements to your final projects that are beyond your or our control.
* If your project requires a back-end, we suggest that you use a Backend-as-a-Service like [Deployd](http://deployd.com/video.html)(free) or [Backendless](https://backendless.com/)(free/paid). In terms of 'needs escalation' go through these cascade of options and stop at the first option where your needs are met:

```
No Backend (Data stored in JSON) > 
  Third-Party Services (Data stored with Facebook/Imgur etc) > 
    Backend-as-a-Service (Data with Service provider) > 
	  Web Framework (Application served by RoR/Django/Drupal, data stored in your own database) >
		Roll your own (For the love of God, don't! You are on your own!)
```

* As for the reliance on Frameworks: 

We genuinely want to find a balance between having the final project be a testament to your FEWD skills and it representing the best possible effort with the framework ecosystems in mind.

What we want to see in your final projects are codebases that consist of code that has been hand-coded by you. For HTML this means structuring the content, for CSS styling your page, and for JS have complete control and understanding of the interactions, logic & control flow of your application. Just dropping in some jQuery plugins or CSS Frameworks won't cut it. They may expedite your development process, but they won't showcase your skill. So here's our rule of thumb:

Build a functional website from scratch by yourself, relying on nothing more than the grid system and mixin library of your choice, and use frameworks exclusively as embelishments.

We don't want you to develop your web sites in a vaccuum, but we do want to see you build something from the ground up, iterating through all the pain point that frameworks sometimes take away. It's important that you go through this process so you'll be better equiped to handle them when the training wheels come off. 

Frameworks are great to give you a head-start, but they aren't flexible enough to accomodate every possible idea/feature/design. So, we recommend you pick the grid system that feels right for you, and start building on top of that. From the wireframes and the work in class you've shown us, we're confident that they are all within the realm of your abilities! We aren't killing off any splendour by restricting a reliance on frameworks. 

So for jQuery and other JS libraries, please restrict their usage to those that don't put a 'defining mark' on your work. I.e. helper methods and small libraries are fine, but don't let them dictate how your site is structured, looks or functions! 

## Wireframe Feedback

### Alex

Looks good! Build the prototype, we'll be happy with just mock user flow. If you want to actually make the prototype work, look into backendless, as they provide image uploads through their JavaSCript SDK.

### Cedric

#### -----------

### Denis

#### CV

Pretty straightforward, so you can experiment with pulling in third-party services. Or coming up with spiffy interactions/designs. Run with it! 

#### Trade data dashboard.

This one isn't as appropriate for the class:

* Stand-alone project with predictable interaction patterns with third-party services. So interaction with services that you built/setup yourself is fine, public APIs are fine, but please refrain from using company services to feed or power your application. 

### Eric

#### 3D Printer Matching

-------- Love the idea. Now let's see some wireframes! 

### Leo

#### Spam Reader

We believe that the front-end is doable, the back-end isn't within the scope of the class. Think through the views (layouts/functions) that you want your app to have and start building the CSS + HTML for those views. You can add JavaScript interactivity as the course progresses. 

### Matt

#### POI Mapper for Hong Kong

We are confident that you can pull this off ... but are you confident that you can put in the time to make it so? These are the things that you'll need to figure out that are beyond the scope of the course. 

* Authentication
* Persistance layer
* Data Sourcing
* Data preparation 
* Decide on your mapping ecosystem. Google Maps/Nokia [Here](http://developer.here.com/javascript_api_explorer)/OpenStreetMap

### Maureen

#### Hong Kong Event Roulette

We suggest you build the prototype with static content, and if the site works, you can always scale up with a backend and add 'event adding' functionality.

### Sean

#### Coconut Inc.

Good to go! Things not covered in class :

* Parrallax (maybe, if others are interested in it.)
* Styling Googls Maps (pretty straightforward though!)
